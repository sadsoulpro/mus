<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
Initial Request: загрузи данное приложение из гитхаба (Load this application from GitHub).
The user then provided a GitHub URL: 

After successfully loading and setting up the application, the user provided a series of feature requests:

1.  **Admin Panel Subscription Management**:
    *   Remove Ultimate plan from the app.
    *   Add a function for the Owner to change their own subscription for testing.

2.  **Odesli/Autofill Enhancement**:
    *   Add search by UPC code to the Autofill field.
    *   Update placeholders and user notifications to reflect the UPC/link search capability.
    *   Add a list of new music platforms.

3.  **API Key Integration**:
    *   Add provided API keys for Resend and Hugging Face.

4.  **Multi-language Support (Internationalization)**:
    *   Add a language selector (RU, EN, ES) in the header.
    *   Auto-detect browser language, with EN as the fallback.
    *   Translate the entire site (landing, auth, dashboard, page builder, public pages, system messages).

5.  **Follow-up on Translation**:
    *   The user specified several pages inside the authenticated dashboard that were missed during the initial translation: , , , , , , , and .
    *   The user then provided further feedback with screenshots, noting that the  page was still untranslated, the sidebar link  needed a proper translation, and the  link was pushing the  button off-screen.
    *   After these were fixed, the user's final request was to finish translating the  to English and Spanish.

**User's preferred language**: русский (Russian)

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack MyTrack application (FastAPI backend, React frontend, MongoDB) for musicians. It has user authentication (JWT), role-based access (Owner, Admin, User), and Odesli/Songlink integration for autofilling music links via URL or UPC code.

A custom internationalization (i18n) system has been implemented, supporting Russian (RU), English (EN), and Spanish (ES). The vast majority of the application, including the landing page, auth pages, and most of the authenticated user dashboard, has been successfully translated. API keys for Resend and Hugging Face are stored in the backend environment.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Translating the  component. The user pointed out that while it worked in Russian, it was not translated for English and Spanish. The agent was in the middle of a large-scale refactor of the file, adding translation keys to  and systematically replacing hardcoded Russian text with the  function.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Complete translation of the Admin Panel (P0)**
    -   **Description**: The  component contains a large amount of hardcoded Russian text, which prevents it from being displayed correctly in English or Spanish.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent has already added a significant number of translation keys to the  section of  and has performed multiple  operations to update . However, the process was not complete.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Review  to find any remaining hardcoded Russian text.
        2.  For any remaining text, add corresponding keys to the  section in  for EN, RU, and ES.
        3.  Replace the hardcoded text in  with the  function call.
        4.  Restart the frontend service: frontend: ERROR (not running)
frontend: started.
        5.  Log in as the owner ( / ).
        6.  Navigate to the Admin Panel.
        7.  Use the  tool to verify the panel displays correctly in English (default), then switch the language to Spanish and take another screenshot to confirm the translation.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Fulfills the user's explicit request to make the entire application, including administrative sections, fully multilingual.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y (The overall i18n task required multiple follow-ups)
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

-   **Issue 2: Mixed language in PageBuilder preview (P2)**
    -   **Description**: The agent noted that while testing PageBuilder, the preview area showed some text in Russian (Здесь появятся ссылки) even when the main UI was in English.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Inspect .
        2.  Locate the code responsible for rendering the preview section.
        3.  Identify why that specific text is not being translated with the rest of the page. It might be a static component or have its text derived from a different, non-reactive source.
        4.  Refactor the code to use the  function from the  hook.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Ensures a consistent and professional user experience by eliminating language mixing.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete the internationalization (i18n) of the Admin Panel (P0)**
    - **Where to resume**: The agent was performing a series of  operations on . The next step is to continue this process until all visible text is sourced from the  file.
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: The Admin Panel will be fully functional and usable for English, Russian, and Spanish-speaking administrators.
    - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    - **Blocked on something**: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Future Task (P2)**: Refactor the backend to load  strictly from environment variables, removing the hardcoded fallback.
*   **Future Task (P2)**: Refactor the backend to make the  configurable via an environment variable instead of being hardcoded.
*   **Future Task (P3)**: Investigate and optimize potential N+1 database queries in the admin panel for better performance at scale.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Completed Dashboard Translations**: Fully translated the following pages that were previously missed: , , and .

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent initially declared the i18n task finished twice prematurely. The first time, it missed several pages which the user listed. The second time, it overlooked that the  page was a separate component and also missed the sidebar layout issues. Finally, the agent did not check the  in languages other than Russian, which the user had to point out as the final remaining piece of the translation task.</analysis>
